        <h2>What does the tag do?</h2>
        <p>
            The &lt;img&gt; tag in HTML is like a special box you use to put pictures
             on a webpage. It's like having a frame where you can show a photograph or
             a drawing. You can also describe the picture in case someone can't see it. 
             This is helpful for people who can't see well or are using special devices 
             to read the webpage. Ultimately, the &lt;img&gt; tag is how you make images 
             appear on your webpage, and it's also a way to be kind to all the visitors, 
             no matter how they experience your site!
        </p>

        <h2>Why is this tag beneficial?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Visual Content:</b> Images can enhance the visual appeal of a web page,
                 making it more engaging and attractive to users</li>
            <li>
                <b>Information Conveyance:</b> Images can convey information more effectively than 
                text alone. They can be used to illustrate concepts, products, or ideas.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Responsive Design:</b> Images can be made responsive using HTML and CSS, adapting 
                to different screen sizes and devices, thus improving the mobile-friendliness of a website.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How does the tag work?</h2>
        <p>
            The &lt;img&gt; tag in HTML is used to embed an image into a webpage. It stands for 
            "image." This tag allows you to display images on your web page, whether they 
            are photographs, illustrations, icons, or any other type of graphical content. 
            The &lt;img&gt; tag is a self-closing tag, meaning it doesn't require a closing tag 
            because it doesn't contain any content between opening and closing tags.
        </p>

        <h2>A small list of attributes.</h2>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Attribute</th>
                <th>What the Attribute Does</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>src</td>
                <td>This attribute specifies the source URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the 
                    image you want to display. The URL can point to an image file on your server 
                    or a remote server. This attribute is mandatory.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>width</td>
                <td> Specifies the width of the image in pixels. This can be an absolute value 
                    (e.g., width="300") or a relative value (e.g., width="50%").</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>height</td>
                <td>Specifies the height of the image in pixels. Similar to the width attribute, 
                    you can use absolute or relative values.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>title</td>
                <td>Provides additional information about the image that is displayed as a 
                    tooltip when the user hovers their mouse over the image.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
